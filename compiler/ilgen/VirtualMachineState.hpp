/**
 * @brief Interface for expressing virtual machine state variables to JitBuilder
 *
 * VirtualMachineState is an interface that language compilers will implement
 * to define all the aspects of the virtual machine state that the JIT compiler will
 * simulate (operand stacks, virtual registers like "pc", "sp", etc.). The interface
 * has four functions: 1) Commit() to cause the simulated state to be written to the
 * actual virtual machine state, 2) Reload() to set the simulated machine state based
 * on the current virtual machine state, 3) MakeCopy() to make an identical copy of
 * the curent virtual machine state object, and 4) MergeInto() to perform the actions
 * needed for the current state to be merged with a second virtual machine state.
 *
 * ##Usage
 *
 * Commit() is typically called when transitioning from compiled code to the interpreter.
 *
 * Reload() is typically called on the transition back from the interpreter to compiled
 * code.
 *
 * MakeCopy() is typically called when control flow edges are created: the current vm state
 * must also become the initial vm state at the target of the control flow edge and be
 * able to evolve independently from the current vm state.
 *
 * MergeInto() is typically called when one compiled code path needs to merge into a second
 * compiled code path (think the bottom of an if-then-else control flow diamond). At the
 * merge point, the locations of all aspects of the simulated machine state must be
 * identical so that the code below the merge point will compute correct results.
 * MergeInto() typically causes the current simulated machine state to be written to the
 * locations that were used by an existing simulated machine state. The "other" object
 * passed to MergeInto() must have the exact same shape (number of components and each
 * component must also match in its type).
 *
 * Language compilers should extend this base class, add instance variables for all
 * necessary virtual machine state variables (using classes like VirtualMachineRegister
 * and VirtualMachineOperandStack) and then implement Commit(), Reload(), MakeCopy(),
 * and MergeInto() to call Commit(), Reload(), MakeCopy(), and MergeInto(), respectively, on
 * each individual instance variable. It feels like boilerplate, but this approach makes
 * it easy for the compiler to reference individual virtual machine state variables and
 * at the same time permits complete flexibility in how the VM-wide Commit(), Reload(),
 * MakeCopy(), and MergeInto() operations can be implemented.
